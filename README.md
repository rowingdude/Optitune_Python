OptiTune Python: Python Bindings for OptiTune API
Overview

OptiTune Python will provide easy access to the OptiTune hyperparameter tuning and model optimization platform's API using Python. It aims to allow data scientists and developers to fully control and automate OptiTune's functionality through Python 3.
Features

 Clean, Pythonic API for accessing OptiTune API endpoints like creating jobs, datasets, etc
 Detailed documentation of the underlying REST API resources and how they map to Python functions
 Support for authentication, headers, and requests required by OptiTune
 Response parsing and Python native data types for OptiTune resources
 Easy job configuration and execution of hyperparameter sweeps
 Tracking logs and results for optimization jobs
 Visualizations for monitored metrics like loss, accuracy etc
 Utilities for exporting optimization artifacts like best model parameters

Documentation

As part of this library, we will fully document the underlying OptiTune REST API, detailing all accessible resources and endpoints in Python docstrings. We will enumerate the available configuration parameters and options at each level, providing programmatic descriptions alongside the requests interface.

Examples and guides for common tasks like initiating a Bayesian search job or retrieving its best result will be included.
Development

OptiTune Python will support Python 3.6 and higher. It will be open source and hosted publicly on Github. Contributions will be welcomed through merge requests. Unit testing coverage criteria will be established and integration tests will validate functionality against actual backend API calls.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements to consider!
